            </ul>
            
            <p>Hello, Nat, Daniel, Evan, Alex and anyone else reading this,</p>
            
            <p>We're Daniel and Josh, we're brothers, live in Australia and are the founders of Nutrify.</p>
            
            <h2>What is Nutrify?</h2>
            
            <p>Nutrify is a (very) early stage food education application.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Short version</strong></p>
            
            <p>Take a photo of food and learn about it.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Longer version</strong></p>
            
            <p>Nutrify is a nutritionist/chef/dietician in your pocket.</p>
            
            <p>It allows you to take a photo of food and learn about it.</p>
            
            <p>Food being a food label or food item.</p>
            
            <p>For example, take a photo of a banana and get its nutritional breakdown and more.</p>
            
            <p>Or take a photo of a food label and find out what food additive &quot;222&quot; is (sodium hydrogen sulphite, a preservative).</p>
            
            <p>Got a couple of spare ingredients in the fridge?</p>
            
            <p>Take a photo of them and let Nutrify prepare recipe ideas for you.</p>
            
            <p>As an analogy, you can think of Nutrify as a search engine designed specifically for food.</p>
            
            <p>Or in another way: a Pokédex for food.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The longer version describes a near future version of Nutrify (something the AI grant will help to fund).</p>

            <h2>Why Nutrify?</h2>
            
            <p>Food labels are confusing.</p>
            
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/nutrify-ai-grant-application/main/images/nutrify-confusing-food-labels.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABRXKUYNXTSCZTSHZTOR4ZA4YYX3CIQ" alt="A series of confusing food labels" width=750/>
            
            <p>Obesity is increasing around the world.</p>
            
            <p>Consumers are up against multi-million dollar food marketing campaigns.</p>
            
            <p>Of course not all of these are <em>bad</em>.</p>
            
            <p>But nutrition education, even in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30171-8/fulltext">medical schools</a> (some medical students report receiving less than <a href="https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/05/bmjnph-2019-000049?versioned=true">2-hours nutrition education per year</a>) is lacking.</p>
            
            <p>Nutrify aims to provide a way for people to change this.</p>
            
            <p>Starting with: take a photo of food and learn about it.</p>
            
            <p>Why the camera?</p>
            
            <p>Simplicity is paramount.</p>
            
            <p>And nutrition is complicated.</p>
            
            <p>So anymore than <em>one</em> step to learn more and it's over.</p>
            
            <p>And taking a photo of food and learning things about it is fun.</p>
            
            <p>Learning about food doesn't have to stop at knowing that 100g of banana has 20g of carbohydrates - that's only one dimension.</p>
            
            <p>Imagine taking a photo of an apricot and learning that the word &quot;apricot&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;precocious&quot; because the fruit ripens early. And the letter &quot;a&quot; appears to be added by a mistake in translation. </p>
            
            <p>Bertrand Russell said this kind of <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/philosophy/useless-knowledge-bertrand-russell/">&quot;useless&quot; knowledge</a> only makes the fruit sweeter. </p>
            
            <p>And we agree.</p>
            
            <p>Now what other secrets are out there?</p>
            
            <p>Nutrify plans to find them and help others find them too.</p>
            
            <h2>Who are we/why us?</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/">Daniel Bourke</a>, machine learning engineer/instructor/nutritionist/food scientist/farmer</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I (Daniel) graduated with a food science and nutrition degree (mostly for my own interest) but then started learning machine learning (and teaching it at the same time online), before getting hired as a machine learning engineer.</p>
            
            <p>I now <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/daniel-bourke-52/">teach machine learning to 100,000+ students in 185+ different countries</a> and run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ">YouTube channel with 125k+ subscribers</a> dedicated to machine learning, health and education.</p>
            
            <p>But it's time to combine my loves for food and AI via Nutrify.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-bourke-4b7a3b129/">Joshua Bourke</a>, iOS developer/lifeguard</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I (Joshua) started teaching myself to build iOS apps a couple of years ago.</p>
            
            <p>And after building and publishing a couple of games on the App Store, I started building an app to track my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu results called <a href="https://mybjj.app">MyBJJ</a>. Many people at the gym I train at are now using it and I plan to launch it to a larger audience soon.</p>
            
            <p>As for Nutrify, I like to make apps and I like food. </p>
            
            <h2>Competition</h2>
            
            <p>Visual and text search engines already exist through Google, Bing, Pinterest.</p>
            
            <p>However, these services offer width (search everything) rather than depth (search one topic and make it fun).</p>
            
            <p>Nutrify will differentiate itself with depth rather than width.</p>
            
            <p>Focusing on food and food only.</p>
            
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/nutrify-ai-grant-application/main/images/nutrify-competition.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABRXKUYNZR4HPDRV6QJHLOI6YYX3CFQ" alt="Nutrify competition, Google and Pinterest offer a wide ranging search engine whereas Nutrify will focus on food only" />
            
            <p>There are also existing food education and fitness apps already such as MyFitnessPal, though these applications focus specifically on tracking rather than education.</p>
            
            <p>Nutrify will differentiate itself from existing static tracking apps by being an interactive education app.</p>
            
            <h2>Roadblocks</h2>
            
            <p>Food has an extremely long tail.</p>
            
            <p>And while Nutrify will likely work very well for common, whole foods (e.g. a whole apple versus an apple pie), dishes and other niche food items will be a challenge. </p>
            
            <p>Though we believe we'll be able to leverage the power of recent innovations in vision-language models as well as generative models like Stable Diffusion to handle and generate training data for rare occurrences.</p>
            
            <p>On a longer term horizon, cooking is arguably a harder problem to solve than self-driving because it uses five human senses rather than two.</p>
            
            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Months 1-6</strong> - Build out functionality, cover 500-1000+ whole foods and 99.99% of ingredients on food labels.</li>
            <li><strong>Month 7</strong> - Supermarket test: walk into a random supermarket and Nutrify should be able to identify and offer insights to all food items in the fresh produce section as well as any food label.</li>
            <li><strong>Months 7-12</strong> - Productize and monetise Nutirfy, the goal will be to go to market as soon as possible (to gather data from real-world use), however, once the foundational functionality is in place, the next thing will be making sure it's worth paying for (a prototype is nice but a reliable system is better).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>To begin, Nutrify will start as a standalone app on web/iOS (this is where our specialities are).</p>
            
            <p>Later on it may progress into something like an API that can be integrated into apps such as Snapchat for access to a larger audience.</p>
            
            <h2>What we'll do with the grant funds if we win</h2>
            
            <p>We already have plans to work on Nutrify for the next year at least (self-funding) whenever we have time but the AI grant will speedup this journey significantly.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>$250k cash</strong> - With this we'll both be able to work on Nutrify full-time for at least a year, so progress will be quite fast, if we pay ourselves ~$75k/year each, we'll have plenty to spare for unseen circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>$250k Azure credits</strong> - Most of this will likely go towards GPU compute (8x A100 GPUs for a year on Azure is ~$110k). Though I'd like to see how far we can go with just fine-tuning pretrained models. Hosting will be almost free due to most of compute happening on device (network latency doesn't make for a fun time).</li>
            <li><strong>$10,000 in human-labelling credits from Scale.ai</strong> - I (Daniel) have a feeling that most of the labelling will be done by large vision-language models (or self-supervised) but we'll use these credits for creating gold-standard ground truths to compare auto-labels to.</li>
            </ul>
